## Project Description
This project involves creating a Java console calculator. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Users can input two numbers and select an operation, with the result displayed on the console. A loop is used to allow multiple calculations, and users can exit by selecting 5.

## Tools Used
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 24**: For writing and running the code.
- **VS Code**: For code editing.
- **Terminal/Command Prompt with javac**: For compiling the code using the `javac` compiler.

## Code
- `Calculator.java`: The main Java file containing all calculation methods and logic.

## Step-by-Step Process
1. Created the Java file (`Calculator.java`) using VS Code.
2. Implemented methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Used `Scanner` to take user input.
4. Employed a `while` loop and `switch` expression to enable multiple calculations.
5. Compiled the code with `javac Calculator.java` using JDK 24.
6. Ran the code with `java Calculator` and tested it.
7. Uploaded the code to the GitHub repository.

## Results
The code works successfully and allows users to perform all basic calculations.
